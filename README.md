The aim of our project is to model a System device which runs on augmented reality-based operating system. This System has access to various sensors and devices in mobile phone which are used for speech recognition, image processing, object recognition and virtual buttons which are used as input for System. This System computes the input and produces the desired output. It also has a camera which is used for recording live events. It has a futuristic play store feature where we can download the AR apps, AR games and AR supported videos and software which runs on this System. This System can be connected to other mobiles and cellular devices using a Bluetooth module for data streaming.
